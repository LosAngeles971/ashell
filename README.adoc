= S(h)entinel

S(h)entinel is a simple program, written in Golang, to wrap a Linux  _shell_, in order to provide functionalities to audit every commands executed by the user.

The main use case is using S(h)entinel to audit commands execute by user from a root shell, generally due to security regulations. 

Indeed, the user may starts s(h)entinel this way:

[source,bash]
----
sudo s-h-entinel
#
----

Once started S(h)entinel, the user got the shell (for example Bash) and it can normally execute commands.
S(h)entinel reads all incoming from the stdin and stdout of the shell, then it processes the content as lines of text, in order to audit every line to different possible targets.
